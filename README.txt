James Jewson's Portfolio site

This is my first website built with extra strong attention to detail, clarity, and a clean, professional look. 
In this site will be links to my portfolio projects.

Some ways this site differs (or will differ in the future) from the template listed below:
-Increased opening transition time
-Different text
-New Background
-Lighter, cleaner feel from original




















This site uses the following template.

Dimension by HTML5 UP

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
